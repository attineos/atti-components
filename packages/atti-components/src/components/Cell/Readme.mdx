Cells work together with the Grid component. They allow you to change layout based on viewport size.

Cells are mobile first so if you don't specify sizes for each breakpoint, it will be inferred from previous one.

In order to do not show a cell on a specific device you might pass a falsy value on the related cols prop element.

## Example

```js
<Grid>
  <Cell
    cols={[
      [1, 7], // Mobile
      [1, 7], // Tablet
      [1, 5], // Desktop
      //xlDesktop is inferred from previous one
    ]}
  >
    <Text>Cells on one line</Text>
  </Cell>
  <Cell cols={[[1, 7], [1, 7], [5, 9]]}>
    <Text>Then goes to new line</Text>
  </Cell>
  <Cell cols={[[1, 7], [1, 7], [9, 13]]}>
    <Text>on mobile and tablets</Text>
  </Cell>
  <Cell cols={[false, null, [1, 13]]}>
      <Text>Only on desktop cell</Text>
  </Cell>
</Grid>
```
