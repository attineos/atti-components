Grid component works together with the Cell component. It's reponsible for displaying correctly the Cells based on the size of the viewport.

Basically there are 12 columns for xlDesktop and desktop. And there are 6 columns for tablet and mobile.

## Example

```js
<Grid>
  <Cell
    cols={[
      [1, 7], // Mobile
      [1, 7], // Tablet
      [1, 5], // Desktop
      //xlDesktop is infered from previous one
    ]}
  >
    <Text>Cells on one line</Text>
  </Cell>
  <Cell cols={[[1, 7], [1, 7], [5, 9]]}>
    <Text>Then goes to new line</Text>
  </Cell>
  <Cell cols={[[1, 7], [1, 7], [9, 13]]}>
    <Text>on mobile and tablets</Text>
  </Cell>
</Grid>
```

Number of columns and breakpoints can be overriden directly in the theme

<Theme name="breakpoints" />
<Theme name="layout" />
