## Which themes are available ?

By default, atti-components provides 3 themes : <Code language="js">defaultTheme</Code>, <Code language="js">attineosTheme</Code> and <Code language="js">greenyBlueTheme</Code>.

Those themes can be easily overriden and help you to get started to create your website.

## Why a custom ThemeProvider ?

To use atti-components, you have to use our own <Code language="jsx">ThemeProvider</Code> components. This is because we've overriden a bit the way it works to ease theme customization.

Indeed, our ThemeProvider allows dynamic usage of theme values. For example if you change the <Code language="js">theme.spaces.s1</Code> value, this will impact automatically all the components that use this value.

## How to override the theme ?

It has to be done at the ThemeProvider level.

You can simply change the value of our theme or give a second theme to the ThemeProvider with just the values that you want to override :

```js
const customTheme = {
  components: {
    button: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          background: '#FAFAFA',
          text: 'blue',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme} otherTheme={customTheme}>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
)

render(<App />)
```
