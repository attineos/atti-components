A Layout Container defines a Container for your content. This gives a basic layout (ie: some sort of box) for your content to live into.
The type of the container define how his childrens will be handled.

Only defines the container but no rules for his childrens:

```js
<LayoutContainer type="CONTAINER_RAW_TYPE">
  <p>This is some content</p>
  <p>No special layout is applyed to this content as this is a raw container</p>
</LayoutContainer>
```
